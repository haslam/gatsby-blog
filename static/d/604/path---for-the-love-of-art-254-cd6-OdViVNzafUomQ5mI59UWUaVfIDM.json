Often times, I find myself getting lost in a gallery as it feeds my mind and chills my bones. I find it serves me with some sort of telepathy where I’m able to live in a different time without any form of human teleportation [if available].</p>\n<p>I try to form the habit of collecting beautiful art works for my very sanity. I guess I can say I’m still working on it - you know these things cost some quid haha [pardon my use]. Anyways, this post is a kick-start to a series of post I shall be sharing with you on art and photography (outdoors and whatever beauty holds my eyes). Even some daring and creative activities I shall be getting myself into in the coming weeks ouch!! Wait for it as it loads…</p>\n<h1>My ask</h1>\n<p>Not much ask here till I wow you with some awesomeness. So, my little ask is that you look out for my next post on photography and art generally as I pick up my task of driving you through my lens.</p>\n<p>Thanks guys!</p>\n<p>Best</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My love for Art","date":"November 17, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/for-the-love-of-art/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tableau/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to tag"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/A-bit-of-reduce/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A mini look into Array.reduce()!"}}}}
