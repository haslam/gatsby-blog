&lt;p&gt;JavaScript‚Äôs reduce method executes a provided reducer function on each member of a given array resulting in a single output - &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce&quot;&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Basic function&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;//Consider an array on numbers as
const arrayList = [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

//Throw the array into reduce for a single sum total, passing in an accumulator, 
// a current value, and an initial value [optional]

const arrayReducer = arrayList.reduce((accumulator, cuurentValue) =&amp;gt; accumulator + cuurentValue, 0);

//outputs 41
console.log(arrayReducer)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So what just happened?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reduce() takes a callback function and an optional initialValue (in this case, 0)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What‚Äôs an accumulator?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the array &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]&lt;/code&gt; supplied to reduce with initialValue 0 appended to its‚Äô tail, reduce performs summation as such:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from left to right:
a. initialValue / old acucmulator
b. arrayList item value
c. new accumulator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;a + b = c&lt;/code&gt;. then &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; becomes the new &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;0 + 2 = 2
2 + 4 = 6
6 + 5 = 11
11 + 6 = 17
17 + 7 = 24
24 + 8 = 32
32 + 9 = 41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What if the supplied initialValue &gt; 0?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say we supplied an initialValue of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;, no worries. reduce just use that as the starting &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; in our case. Which will increase our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, our sum will also be increased by &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; in our case maing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;51&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks guys!&lt;/p&gt;

If not, make it a date with yourself to embrace the beauty it unwraps‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://hassansalami.ca/how-to-Gatsby/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://hassansalami.ca/how-to-Gatsby/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Dec 2018 05:16:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Have you gotten your fingers and mind beautified by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/&quot;&gt;Gatsby.js&lt;/a&gt; yet? If not, make it a date with yourself to embrace the beauty it unwraps for your blogs and other web usage - as your need permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might have noticed, this website itself was built with Gatsby from the ground up and I‚Äôve enjoyed and learned from every bit of it from setup to deployment at zero or no cost at all - how awesome eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So, what the heck is Gatsby then?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good question! Gatsby is a ReactJS-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator that provides you with the capability to build beautiful modern websites for yourself and others, even securely. As you may or may not know, ReactJS - a JavaScript web framework from the hustles of the good guys at Facebook has taken the web community in an amazing storm quickly defaulting to the framework of choice of beautiful web developers [others are beautiful, too okay haha]. You know what happens when you combine the sword of ReactJS, the horse of GraphQL [more on this to grace its own page], the flow of Markdown path, the flexibility of a PWA [bet you didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs a static PWA generator eh? Gotcha! üëä], and the shield of your chosen host? ü§î. I guess it‚Äôs okay to call it a cool flex right üòé.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Okay, do I hear you say enough already! how do I get started?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought you‚Äôll never asked üòä. Well, If you‚Äôre already familiar with web development and want to get your feet running with Gatsby, I suggest you visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start&quot;&gt;Quick Start&lt;/a&gt; page where you‚Äôll basically catch the whole gist from install the cli via &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install --global gatsby-cli&lt;/code&gt; if you may go global, generating your new gatsby site project with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby new project-name&lt;/code&gt; where project name is your project name, to delving into the project directory to uncover and learn magic through mistakes and creativity. Go through the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file to see the script options available to you to run in development, production, or even serving production locally. It should be fun!
Oops! sorry if you are new to this as I‚Äôm new to this post writeup. Okay, If unlike the previous folks, you‚Äôd like to pick it up from the very get-go, I suggest you visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/&quot;&gt;tutorial page&lt;/a&gt; to get your feet wet. It‚Äôs rather short list of setup and todos to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My promise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, let‚Äôs face it. Sometimes it might be sorta daunting to read through some docs [believe me, Gatsby does a good job with theirs] that you‚Äôd appreciate a little hand. For this, I‚Äôll make a mini ‚Äúbuild it‚Äù post where we run through the offers of Gatsby by building a little blog like this very yours truly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So, what‚Äôs my ask of you?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you! If you‚Äôve made it this far, you‚Äôre one of my inspirations and I promise to keep making time for you my ‚òù.
My ask is that you familiarize yourself with all or a little of Gatsby‚Äôs offers and we shall walk through the rest on our next Gatsby meeting here - that‚Äôs a virtual date eh! Also, I‚Äôd really appreciate you follow me on my little socials [working on getting out of shadows to being more social with you]. Trust me, I myself follow a lot of beautiful people out there and I learn a lot from them [sure, I pass along their awesome tweets, too].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I‚Äôve got to go get myself a sandwich and hmmm.. wather will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks guys!&lt;/p&gt;

Often times, I find myself getting lost in a gallery as it feeds my mind and chills my bones. I find it serves me with some sort of telepathy where I‚Äôm able to live in a different time without any form of human teleportation [if available].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to form the habit of collecting beautiful art works for my very sanity. I guess I can say I‚Äôm still working on it - you know these things cost some quid haha [pardon my use]. Anyways, this post is a kick-start to a series of post I shall be sharing with you on art and photography (outdoors and whatever beauty holds my eyes). Even some daring and creative activities I shall be getting myself into in the coming weeks ouch!! Wait for it as it loads‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My ask&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much ask here till I wow you with some awesomeness. So, my little ask is that you look out for my next post on photography and art generally as I pick up my task of driving you through my lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks guys!&lt;/p&gt;

Call me a late comer or some sort, no worries haha. Seriously though, I‚Äôve had the habit of making my notes of lessons learned on my MS OneNote, Notepadd++, and Google Docs cos of their memory retention capability - I know some will disagree with the term but hey, it just works for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I‚Äôd usually drop some goodies and hurties in there as they come [to be referenced later] - pardon me, I tend to use ‚Äù[]‚Äù a lot to drill. However, for the love of good relief after browsing through the notes at a later time, I tought it would be nice to share such with me fellow community of beautiful net users scoring the net for a little or more pinch of ‚ÄúAha!‚Äú.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bear with me as I navigate the route and get used to it with you reading through my posts and pages haha. I promise it will get more and more interesting as I find time to write up posts from my archive of notes and lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank guys!&lt;/p&gt;
