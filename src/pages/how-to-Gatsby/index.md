Have you gotten your fingers and mind beautified by [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) yet? If not, make it a date with yourself to embrace the beauty it unwraps for your blogs and other web usage - as your need permits.

As you might have noticed, this website itself was built with Gatsby from the ground up and I've enjoyed and learned from every bit of it from setup to deployment at zero or no cost at all - how awesome eh?

#So, what the heck is Gatsby then?

Good question! Gatsby is a ReactJS-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator that provides you with the capability to build beautiful modern websites for yourself and others, even securely. As you may or may not know, ReactJS - a JavaScript web framework from the hustles of the good guys at Facebook has taken the web community in an amazing storm quickly defaulting to the framework of choice of beautiful web developers [others are beautiful, too okay haha]. You know what happens when you combine the sword of ReactJS, the horse of GraphQL [more on this to grace its own page], the flow of Markdown path, the flexibility of a PWA [bet you didn't know it's a static PWA generator eh? Gotcha! üëä], and the shield of your chosen host? ü§î. I guess it's okay to call it a cool flex right üòé.

#Okay, do I hear you say enough already! how do I get started?

Thought you'll never asked üòä. Well, If you're already familiar with web development and want to get your feet running with Gatsby, I suggest you visit the [Quick Start](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start) page where you'll basically catch the whole gist from install the cli via `npm install --global gatsby-cli` if you may go global, generating your new gatsby site project with `gatsby new project-name` where project name is your project name, to delving into the project directory to uncover and learn magic through mistakes and creativity. Go through the `package.json` file to see the script options available to you to run in development, production, or even serving production locally. It should be fun!
Oops! sorry if you are new to this as I'm new to this post writeup. Okay, If unlike the previous folks, you'd like to pick it up from the very get-go, I suggest you visit the [tutorial page](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) to get your feet wet. It's rather short list of setup and todos to get you started.

#My promise

Okay, let's face it. Sometimes it might be sorta daunting to read through some docs [believe me, Gatsby does a good job with theirs] that you'd appreciate a little hand. For this, I'll make a mini "build it" post where we run through the offers of Gatsby by building a little blog like this very yours truly.

#So, what's my ask of you?

Thank you! If you've made it this far, you're one of my inspirations and I promise to keep making time for you my ‚òù.
My ask is that you familiarize yourself with all or a little of Gatsby's offers and we shall walk through the rest on our next Gatsby meeting here - that's a virtual date eh! Also, I'd really appreciate you follow me on my little socials [working on getting out of shadows to being more social with you]. Trust me, I myself follow a lot of beautiful people out there and I learn a lot from them [sure, I pass along their awesome tweets, too].

For now, I've got to go get myself a sandwich and hmmm.. wather will do.

Thanks guys!
