I thought I get into the habit of posting my learnings, mistakes, and experiences as I navigate through my passion on the shoulders of beautiful guys I've had the pleasure of working with. Call me a late comer or some sort, no worries haha. Seriously though, I've had the habit of making my notes of lessons learned on my MS OneNote, Notepadd++, and Google Docs cos of their memory retention capability - I know some will disagree with the term but hey, it just works for me.

Over the years, I'd usually drop some goodies and hurties in there as they come [to be referenced later] - pardon me, I tend to use "[]" a lot to drill. However, for the love of good relief after browsing through the notes at a later time, I tought it would be nice to share such with me fellow community of beautiful net users scoring the net for a little or more pinch of "Aha!".

Please bear with me as I navigate the route and get used to it with you reading through my posts and pages haha. I promise it will get more and more interesting as I find time to write up posts from my archive of notes and lessons.

Thank you!

Best
